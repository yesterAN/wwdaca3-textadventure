# wwdaca3-textadventure
I've retyped this like three times.
The fully functional project should be available at https://yesteran.github.io/wwdaca3-textadventure/
The tutorial I followed to create this project was Briggs, K. (2021, February 3). Make Games with Javascript: Text-Based Adventure. Www.youtube.com. https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=kayFBMl06q8&ab_channel=KevinBriggs
All images were made with Canva or illustrated by me with Procreate for iPad.
Special thanks to Cass, Maya, Tom and MJ for troubleshooting when I couldn't figure out what various specific issues were.
